# lenovo_thinkbook_iml15_touchpad_acpi_fix

This is a temporary fix for Lenovo Thinkbook 14-IML and 15-IML models.

This ACPI table override is intended to bring full functional operation to touchpad (multi-touch, two-finger scroll, etc.) in Linux.

Please refer to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1853277 for details.

It is not needed anymore since Mar,02 2020 when BIOS update CJCN26WW was released.
